                            a radio trade school. He later became a major market disc jockey by age 25. Like many
                            people,
                            Karate took a back seat to family and career until he enrolled with his kids at Grand

                            available
                            for students who cannot train in the evening. Master Mark promises a focused workout and
                            lots
                            of fun. By the way, Master Mark did get a 'real' job; He and his wife Karmal have been
                            running
                            one of the highest ranked Allstate agencies in America right here in Billings, since 1986.
