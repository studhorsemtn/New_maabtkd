                        <p>Master Mark took his first Taekwondo class in 1974 at Cho's Taekwondo in Denver Co while attending
                            a radio trade school. He later became a major market disc jockey by age 25. Like many people,
                            Karate took a back seat to family and career until he enrolled with his kids at Grand Master
                            Karlo Fujiwara's orginal North Park Dojo in the early 1990s. The noon class makes training available
                            for students who cannot train in the evening. Master Mark promises a focused workout and lots
                            of fun. By the way, Master Mark did get a 'real' job; He and his wife Karmal have been running
                            one of the highest ranked Allstate agencies in America right here in Billings, since 1986.
