                </p>
                <p>
                    Taekwondo is probably most recognizable by its emphasis on kicking techniques although the hands and fists are equally important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the adept, Taekwondo is more than a sport or form of exercise. It is also a way of life, particularly because it instills
                    a practice of strict, self-imposed discipline and an ideal of high moral re-armament. The tenets of the
                    International Dae Myung Moo Do Federation (respect, etiquette, loyalty, modesty, patience) enable practitioners
                    to develop these attitudes within themselves and to offer this way of life to others who join our dojang
                    (training hall) regimen. Taekwondo arms the weak with an effective weapon to defend himself or herself
                    against violence and attempts at intimidation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regular training is necessary to keep oneself in top form and physical condition. Training the muscles of the body harnesses
                    the available positive and negative powers generated by every muscular contraction and relaxation. The
                    focus on skill, develops neural-muscular patterns of readiness to react appropriately to the attacker’s
                    force or momentum. The slightest push or pull is all that is needed to upset the assailant’s equilibrium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several years of regular Taekwondo practice will condition your reflexes and temper your maturity toward assertive non-aggressive
                    patience. You will find repeated emphasis is placed upon regular training to master the techniques of
                    attack and defense. The hours you spend in training and practice outside of classtime will reward you
                    with appropriate reactions to save a life or prevent injury should the need arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you practice Taekwondo for the exercise alone, the enjoyment derived and results achieved will fully justify the time.
                    As an exercise, it is equally suitable­­­­­­­­­­–with some considerations and adjustment of conditions–for
                    the young and old alike.

                <p>Modern Judo has its origins in Jujitsu, a fighting art that can be traced back over a thousand years into
                    Japanese history. Judo itself, however, has relatively recent beginnings, owing its existence to Dr.
                    Jigoro Kano in the late 1800s. Until he was 18 years old, Dr. Kano was physically weak. He resolved to
                    improve himself by studying at two Jujitsu schools. He soon realized that each school had its strengths
                    and weaknesses. He believed there was unnecessary roughness and crudeness in the Jujitsu techniques,
                    making it difficult to practice without injury.
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Kano began to reconstruct Jujitsu, taking the good points of Jujitsu and adding his own ideas and founding
                    a new system for “physical culture and mental training.” He called his new system Kodokan Judo.</p>
                <p>The Kodokan (a school for studying the way) was established in 1882. It rapidly became a popular alternative
                    to Jujitsu, and even established Kodokan Judo’s supremacy over Jujitsu in a tournament in 1886.</p>
                <p>Men’s Judo was first included in the Olympic games in 1964 and became a permanent part of the Games in 1972.
                    In 1992, women’s Judo became a part of the Olympic Games.</p>
                <p>Dr. Kano defined the two principles of Kodokan Judo as “Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort” and “Mutual
                    Welfare and Benefit.” He felt that “physical education should train the body to be strong, healthy and
                    useful in actual life and also make a contribution to the culture of the mind.” His system of Judo is
                    just that.</p>
