                <p>We dedicate the Martial Arts Academy of Billings to our mentor, the
                    Late Grand Master Karlo Fujiwara who helped us establish our
                    school back in 2001. We are honored he conducted his final test
                    in Judo at our school in May 2010. We have many great memories
                    of the times we spent together. His guidance, dedication, hard
                    work, respect and indomitable spirit toward ensuring our success
                    will never be forgotten.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Martial Art training conditions the mind, body and spirit</strong></h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Martial arts training is more than skilled movement. To the
                            adept, it is also a way of life, particularly because
                            it instills a practice of strict, self-imposed discipline
                            and an ideal of high moral re-armament. The tenets respect,
                            etiquette, loyalty, modesty, patience enable practitioners
                            to develop these attitudes within themselves and to offer
                            this way of life to others who join our dojang (training
                            hall) regimen. Training in the martial arts arms the
                            weak with an effective weapon to defend himself or herself
                            against violence and attempts at intimidation.</p>
                        <p>Regular training is necessary to keep oneself in top form
                            and physical condition. Training the muscles of the body
                            harnesses the available positive and negative powers
                            generated by every muscular contraction and relaxation.
                            The focus on skill, develops neural-muscular patterns
                            of readiness to react appropriately to the attacker’s
                            force or momentum. The slightest push or pull is all
                            that is needed to upset the assailant’s equilibrium.
                        </p>
                        <p>Several years of regular martial arts practice will condition
                            your reflexes and temper your maturity toward assertive
                            non-aggressive patience. You will find repeated emphasis
                            is placed upon regular training to master the techniques
                            of attack and defense. The hours you spend in training
                            and practice outside of class-time will reward you with
                            appropriate reactions to save a life or prevent injury
                            should the need arise.
                        </p>
                        <p> If you practice any martial art for the exercise alone, the
                            enjoyment derived and results achieved will fully justify
                            the time. As an exercise, it is equally suitable with
                            some considerations and adjustment of conditions for
                            the young and old alike.

                        <h2><strong>The symbolism of Martial Arts Academy of Billings Certificates</strong></h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>In Western cultures, dragons are generally considered evil
                            and are associated with fire and destruction. While in
                            the East, dragons are considered auspicious or good luck
                            and are associated with water and fruitfulness.</p>

                        <p>The dragon in Asian mythology is a symbol of the emperor
                            -- full of power and vitality. Tigers in Asian mythology
                            generally represent martial ability and power. Primarily
                            consigned to the general of the army, the tiger denotes
                            physical power rather than the spiritual power represented
                            by the dragon.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Yin Yang symbol is a recognizable symbol in many cultures.
                            Yin is the dark side of the symbol which connotes the
                            negative outcome of events; whereas, Yang is the bright
                            side, depicting the positive outcome of events. The modicum
                            of dark or light in either side reveals the seed of the
                            very element that will produce the other’s demise. Thus,
                            the seed of dark eventually dispels the light, and the
                            seed of light dispels the dark. They are complementary
                            opposites. As in the universe, positive and negative
                            both exist to create a balance. The Korean characters
                            which represent Chun Ji mean “Heaven and Earth” and refer
                            to the creation of the world or the beginning of human
                            history.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Martial Arts Academy of Billings certificate embodies
                            the yin yang concept, using Asian mythological creatures
                            to complete the visual reference. The dragon’s spiritual
                            power balances out the military power of the tiger. Just
                            as on our certificate, the visual representation of both
                            elements balances out on the sheet of paper. Thus, receiving
                            this certificate is symbolic of the beginning, or birth,
                            of balance in the individual practitioner, spiritually,
                            mentally and physically, and signifies the individual’s
                            growth toward ultimate unity or serenity.</p>
